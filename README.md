# Visual-Thalamocortical-Mechanisms-of-State-Dependent-Activity
This repository contains the following code from the publication: "Visual Thalamocortical Mechanisms of Waking State Dependent Activity and Alpha Oscillations" by Nestvogel and McCormick (2021):

Analysis of action potentials (threshold, half-width, frequency) that were recorded via whole-cell recordings.
Basic script to detect periods of high FFT power within the 3-5 Hz frequency range (followed by manual curation).
